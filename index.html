<h2>INDEX<h2>
<p>Web, <strong>short for the world wide<u> <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/script.html" targer="_blank" title="W3C">web</a></u></strong>, is sometimes called WWW after the first letter.</p>
<p>If you interpret the Web as it is in English, it means "spider web,"
which can be translated directly as "spider web the size of the world.</p><p>"
Prior to the web, the Internet had an early command-based structure and had to
write different commands depending on the hardware and OS.</p>
<p>However, research on information storage and usage environments on the Internet
has enabled the Web to operate in one kind of standard user environment using any
kind of computer.</p>
